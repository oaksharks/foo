Why: An All-in-One Causal Learning API
***************************************

Want to use YLearn in a much easier way? Try the all-in-one API `Why`!

`Why` is an API which encapsulates almost everything in YLearn, such as *identifying causal effects* and *scoring a trained estimator model*. It provides to users a simple
and efficient way to use our package: one can directly pass the only thing you have, the data, into
`Why` and call various methods of it rather than learning multiple concepts such as adjustment set before being able to find interesting information hidden in your data. `Why`
is designed to enable the full-pipeline of causal inference: given data, it first tries to discover the causal graph
if not provided, then it attempts to find possible variables as treatments and identify the causal effects, after which
a suitable estimator model will be trained to estimate the causal effects, and, finally, the policy is evaluated to suggest the best option
for each individual.

    `Why` can help almost every part of the whole pipeline of causal inference.

Example usages
================

In this chapter, we use dataset `california_housing` to show how to use `Why`.  We prepare the dataset with code below:

.. code-block:: python

    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing

    housing = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)
    data = housing.frame
    outcome = housing.target_names[0]
    data[outcome] = housing.target


The variable `data` is our prepared dataset.

Fit Why with default settings
-----------------------------------

The simplest way to use `Why` is creating `Why` instance with default settings and fit it with training data and outcome name only.

.. code-block:: python

    from ylearn import Why

    why = Why()
    why.fit(data, outcome)

    print('identified treatment:',why.treatment_)
    print('identified adjustment:',why.adjustment_)
    print('identified covariate:',why.covariate_)
    print('identified instrument:',why.instrument_)

    print(why.causal_effect())

Outputs:

.. code-block:: console

    identified treatment: ['MedInc', 'HouseAge']
    identified adjustment: None
    identified covariate: ['AveRooms', 'AveBedrms', 'Population', 'AveOccup', 'Latitude', 'Longitude']
    identified instrument: None
                  mean       min       max       std
    MedInc    0.411121 -0.198831  1.093134  0.064856
    HouseAge -0.000385 -0.039162  0.114263  0.005845


Fit Why with customized treatments
----------------------------------

We can fit `Why` with argument `treatment` to specify the desired features as treatment.

.. code-block:: python

    from ylearn import Why

    why = Why()
    why.fit(data, outcome, treatment=['AveBedrms', ])

    print('identified treatment:',why.treatment_)
    print('identified adjustment:',why.adjustment_)
    print('identified covariate:',why.covariate_)
    print('identified instrument:',why.instrument_)

    print(why.causal_effect())

Outputs:

.. code-block:: console

    identified treatment: ['AveBedrms']
    identified adjustment: None
    identified covariate: ['MedInc', 'HouseAge', 'AveRooms', 'Population', 'AveOccup', 'Latitude', 'Longitude']
    identified instrument: None
                   mean       min        max       std
    AveBedrms  0.197422 -0.748971  10.857963  0.169682


Identify treatment without fitting `Why`
-------------------------------------------

We can call `Why`'s method `identify` to identify treatment, adjustment, covariate and instrument without fitting it.


.. code-block:: python

    why = Why()
    r=why.identify(data, outcome)

    print('identified treatment:',r[0])
    print('identified adjustment:',r[1])
    print('identified covariate:',r[2])
    print('identified instrument:',r[3])

Outputs:

.. code-block:: console

    identified treatment: ['MedInc', 'HouseAge']
    identified adjustment: None
    identified covariate: ['AveRooms', 'AveBedrms', 'Population', 'AveOccup', 'Latitude', 'Longitude']
    identified instrument: None
