Causal Model
************

:class:`CausalModel` is a core object for performing :ref:`identification` and finding
Instrumental Variables. 

Before introducing the causal model, we should clarify the definition of **interventions** first.
Interventions would be to take the whole population and give every one some operation. 
[Pearl]_ defined the :math:`do`-operator to describe such operations. Probabilistic models can not serve 
to predict the effect of interventions which leads to the need for causal model. 

The formal definition of **causal model** is due to [Pearl]_. A causal model is a triple

.. math::
    
    M = \left< U, V, F\right>

where

* :math:`U` are **exogenous** (variables that are determined by factors outside the model);
* :math:`V` are **endogenous** that are determined by :math:`U \cup V`, and :math:`F` is a set of functions such that

.. math::
        
        V_i = F_i(pa_i, U_i)

with :math:`pa_i \subset V \backslash V_i`. 

For example, :math:`M = \left< U, V, F\right>` is a causal model where

.. math::
    
    V = \{V_1, V_2\}, 
    
    U = \{ U_1, U_2, I, J\},
    
    F = \{F_1, F_2 \}

such that

.. math::

    V_1 = F_1(I, U_1) = \theta_1 I + U_1\\
    V_2 = F_2(V_1, J, U_2, ) = \phi V_1 + \theta_2 J + U_2.

Note that every causal model can be associated with a DAG and encodes necessary information of the causal relationships between variables.
YLearn uses :class:`CausalModel` to represent a causal model and support many operations related to the causal
model such as :ref:`identification`.

.. _identification:

Identification
==============

To characterize the effect of the intervention, one needs to consider the **causal effect** which is a 
causal estimand including the :math:`do`-operator. The action that converts the causal effect into corresponding 
statistical estimands is called :ref:`identification` and is implemented in :class:`CausalModel` in YLearn. Note that not 
all causal effects can be converted to statistical estimands. We refer to such causal effects as not identifiable. We list several identification methods supported by `CausalModel`.

.. topic:: Backdoor adjustment

    The causal effect of :math:`X` on :math:`Y` is given by

    .. math::

        P(y|do(x)) = \sum_w P(y|x, w)P(w)
    
    if the set of variables :math:`W` satisfies the back-door criterion relative to :math:`(X, Y)`.

.. topic:: Frontdoor adjustment

    The causal effect of :math:`X` on :math:`Y` is given by

    .. math::

        P(y|do(x)) = \sum_w P(w|x) \sum_{x'}P(y|x', w)P(x')
    
    if the set of variables :math:`W` satisfies the front-door criterion relative to :math:`(X, Y)` and if
    :math:`P(x, w) > 0`.

.. topic:: General identification

    [Shpitser2006]_ gives a necessary and sufficient graphical condition such that the causal effect
    of an arbitrary set of variables on another arbitrary set can be identified uniquely whenever its identifiable. We 
    call the corresponding action of verifying this condition as **general identification**.

.. topic:: Finding Instrumental Variables

    Instrumental variables are useful to identify and estimate the causal effect of :math:`X` on :math:`Y` when there are 
    unobserved confoundings of :math:`X` and :math:`Y`. A set of variables :math:`Z` is said to be a set of **instrumental variables**
    if for any :math:`z` in :math:`Z`:
    
    1. :math:`z` has a causal effect on :math:`X`.
    
    2. The causal effect of :math:`z` on :math:`Y` is fully mediated by :math:`X`.
    
    3. There are no back-door paths from :math:`z` to :math:`Y`.

.. topic:: Example 1: Identify the causal effect with the general identification method

    .. figure:: graph_un_arc.png
        
        Causal structures where all unobserved variables are removed and their related causations are replaced by
        the confounding arcs (black doted lines with two arrows).
    
    For the causal structure in the figure, we want to identify the causal effect of :math:`X` on :math:`Y` using the *general identification* method. The first
    step is to represent the causal structure with :class:`CausalModel`.
    
    .. code-block:: python
        
        from ylearn.causal_model.graph import CausalGraph
        
        causation = {
            'X': ['Z2'],
            'Z1': ['X', 'Z2'],
            'Y': ['Z1', 'Z3'],
            'Z3': ['Z2'],
            'Z2': [], 
        }
        arcs = [('X', 'Z2'), ('X', 'Z3'), ('X', 'Y'), ('Z2', 'Y')]
        cg = CausalGraph(causation=causation, latent_confounding_arcs=arcs)

    Then we need to define an instance of :class:`CausalModel` for the causal structure encoded in :py:attr:`cg` to perform the identification.

    .. code-block:: python

        from ylearn.causal_model.model import CausalModel
        cm = CausalModel(causal_model=cg)
        stat_estimand = cm.id(y={'Y'}, x={'X'})
        stat_estimand.show_latex_expression()

    >>> :math:`\sum_{Z3, Z1, Z2}[P(Z2)P(Y|Z3, Z2)][P(Z1|Z2, X)][P(Z3|Z2)]`

    The result is the desired identified causal effect of :math:`X` on :math:`Y` in the given causal structure.

.. topic:: Example 2: Identify the causal effect with the back-door adjustment

    .. figure:: backdoor.png

        All nodes are observed variables.
    
    For the causal structure in the figure, we want to identify the causal effect of :math:`X` on :math:`Y` using the *back-door adjustment* method.
    
    .. code-block:: python
        
        from ylearn.causal_model.graph import CausalGraph
        from ylearn.causal_model.model import CausalModel

        causation = {
            'X1': [], 
            'X2': [], 
            'X3': ['X1'], 
            'X4': ['X1', 'X2'], 
            'X5': ['X2'], 
            'X6': ['X'], 
            'X': ['X3', 'X4'], 
            'Y': ['X6', 'X4', 'X5', 'X'], 
        } 

        cg = CausalGraph(causation=causation)
        cm = CausalModel(causal_graph=cg)
        backdoor_set, prob = cm3.identify(treatment={'X'}, outcome={'Y'}, identify_method=('backdoor', 'simple'))['backdoor']

        print(backdoor_set)


    >>> ['X3', 'X4']

.. topic:: Example 3: Find the valid instrumental variables

    .. figure:: iv1.png

        Causal structure for the variables :math:`p, t, l, g`

    We want to find the valid instrumental variables for the causal effect of :math:`t` on :math:`g`.

    .. code-block:: python

        causation = {
            'p':[],
            't': ['p'],
            'l': ['p'],
            'g': ['t', 'l']
        }
        arc = [('t', 'g')]
        cg = CausalGraph(causation=causation, latent_confounding_arcs=arc)
        cm = CausalModel(causal_graph=cg)

        cm.get_iv('t', 'g')

    >>> No valid instrument variable has been found.

    .. figure:: iv2.png

        Another causal structure for the variables :math:`p, t, l, g`

    We still want to find the valid instrumental variables for the causal effect of :math:`t` on :math:`g`
    in this new causal structure.

    .. code-block:: python

        causation = {
            'p':[],
            't': ['p', 'l'],
            'l': [],
            'g': ['t', 'l']
        }
        arc = [('t', 'g')]
        cg = CausalGraph(causation=causation, latent_confounding_arcs=arc)
        cm = CausalModel(causal_graph=cg)

        cm.get_iv('t', 'g')
    
    >>> {'p'}

        Combination of the identify method and the estimate method. However,
        since current implemented estimator models assume (conditionally)
